# What you will learn

In this lab, you will create a functional follower counter for an Instagram post and simulate the increase in followers. You will grasp the fundamentals of managing a count variable to simulate a follower count on a social media platform like Instagram. You will understand the basic principles of managing state (the follower count), updating UI elements dynamically, and triggering actions based on certain conditions in JavaScript.

# Learning objectives

After completing this lab, you will be able to:

- Variables and incrementation: Learn how to use variables in JavaScript to store and modify data, in this case, to simulate increasing follower counts.

- Updating web content: Understand how JavaScript interacts with HTML elements to dynamically update content on a webpage, like displaying follower counts.

- Conditional statements: Explore how to create conditions in code using if-else statements to trigger specific actions based on certain criteria, such as displaying congratulatory messages at follower milestones.

- Function usage: Learn how functions in JavaScript are defined and called to perform specific tasks, enabling the control flow of the program and organizing code for better management and reusability.
